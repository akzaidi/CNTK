\description{
Layer factory function to create a batch-normalization layer.
}
\details{
Batch normalization applies this formula to every input element
(element-wise): y = (x - batch_mean) / (batch_stddev + epsilon) * scale +
bias where batch_mean and batch_stddev are estimated on the minibatch and
scale and bias are learned parameters.

During operation, this layer also estimates an aggregate running mean and
standard deviation for use in inference.

A BatchNormalization layer instance owns its learnable parameter tensors and
exposes them as attributes .scale and .bias. The aggregate estimates are
exposed as attributes aggregate_mean, aggregate_variance, and
aggregate_count.
