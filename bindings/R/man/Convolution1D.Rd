\usage{
Convolution1D(filter_shape, num_filters = NULL,
  activation = activation_identity, init = init_glorot_uniform(),
  pad = FALSE, strides = 1, bias = TRUE, init_bias = 0,

\description{
Layer factory function to create a 1D convolution layer with optional
non-linearity. Same as Convolution() except that filter_shape is verified to
be 1-dimensional. See Convolution() for extensive documentation.
