ConvolutionTranspose3D(filter_shape, num_filters = NULL,
  activation = activation_identity, init = init_glorot_uniform(),
  pad = FALSE, strides = 1, bias = TRUE, init_bias = 0,
  output_shape = NULL, name = "")

\description{
Layer factory function to create a 3D convolution transpose layer with
optional non-linearity. Same as ConvolutionTranspose() except that
filter_shape is verified to be 3-dimensional. See ConvolutionTranspose() for
extensive documentation.
