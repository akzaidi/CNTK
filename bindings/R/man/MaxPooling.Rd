\usage{
MaxPooling(filter_shape, strides = 1, pad = FALSE, name = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_shape}{integer vector defining receptive field}

\item{strides}{integer defining length of stride}

\item{pad}{logical for whether or not the pooling operation should be shifted over the "valid" area of input}

\item{name}{string for the name of the function instance in the network}
}
\description{
Layer factory function to create a max-pooling layer.
Like \code{Convolution()}, \code{MaxPooling()} processes items arranged on an N-dimensional grid, such as an image.
Typically, each item is a vector. For each item, max-pooling computes the element-wise maximum over a window ("receptive field") of items surrounding the itemâ€™s position on the grid.
The size (spatial extent) of the receptive field is given by \code{filter_shape.} E.g. for 2D pooling, filter_shape should be a tuple of two integers, such as (5,5).
